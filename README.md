# Dermatology
Determine what clinical and histopathological features are the most significant predictors that classify patients into specific erythemato-squamous diseases.

# Dataset Information

This database contains 34 attributes, 33 of which are linear valued and one of them is nominal. 

The differential diagnosis of erythemato-squamous diseases is a real problem in dermatology. They all share the clinical features of erythema and scaling, with very little differences. The diseases in this group are psoriasis, seboreic dermatitis, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, cronic dermatitis, and pityriasis rubra pilaris. Usually a biopsy is necessary for the diagnosis but unfortunately these diseases share many histopathological features as well. Another difficulty for the differential diagnosis is that a disease may show the features of another disease at the beginning stage and may have the characteristic features at the following stages. Patients were first evaluated clinically with 12 features. Afterwards, skin samples were taken for the evaluation of 22 histopathological features. The values of the histopathological features are determined by an analysis of the samples under a microscope. 

In the dataset constructed for this domain, the family history feature has the value 1 if any of these diseases has been observed in the family, and 0 otherwise. The age feature simply represents the age of the patient. Every other feature (clinical and histopathological) was given a degree in the range of 0 to 3. Here, 0 indicates that the feature was not present, 3 indicates the largest amount possible, and 1, 2 indicate the relative intermediate values.

The names and id numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database.

# Project: AI-Powered Dermatology Diagnostic System

# Dermatology Diagnosis Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on using **machine learning** to improve the diagnosis of **erythemato-squamous diseases** based on clinical and histopathological data. These diseases, including **psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, chronic dermatitis,** and **pityriasis rubra pilaris**, present similar clinical symptoms, making accurate diagnosis challenging. Our goal is to develop a **decision support system** and analyze the most important features contributing to disease classification.

## Project Goals

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Development of a Diagnostic Decision Support System
üîπ **Objective:**  
Build a **machine learning model** that assists dermatologists in accurately diagnosing skin diseases using **clinical and histopathological features**.  

üîπ **How It Works:**  
Develop a system where **doctors can input patient data** (symptoms, test results, etc.) into a **web-based interface** or **API**, and the machine learning model will **analyze the data** to provide a **predicted diagnosis**.  

üîπ **Why It Matters:**  
- Reduces **misdiagnosis** by providing **data-driven insights**.  
- Assists dermatologists in differentiating between diseases with **similar symptoms**.  
- Can be **integrated into telemedicine** services to improve accessibility.  

üîπ **Implementation:**  
- Train a **classification model** (e.g., **Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks**) using the **Dermatology dataset**.  
- **To be determined**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Importance Analysis
üîπ **Objective:**  
Identify the most **critical features** that influence disease classification, helping dermatologists understand which factors matter most.  

üîπ **Why It Matters:**  
- Helps **prioritize key clinical & histopathological indicators** in medical assessments.  
- Reduces the reliance on **less significant** features, optimizing **diagnostic procedures**.  
- Improves **interpretability** of AI-driven diagnoses, making models more **trustworthy for doctors**.  

üîπ **Implementation:**  
- Use techniques like **SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations)** and **Feature Importance from Random Forest**.  
- Visualize the top contributing factors to **each disease class**.  
- Compare different feature selection techniques to find the **most reliable indicators**.

## Next Steps
‚úî Train & optimize the **classification model**  
‚úî Perform **feature importance analysis**  
‚úî Build a **user-friendly web interface**  

üöÄ **Final Goal:** Deliver an AI-powered **diagnostic assistant** that can **aid doctors in real-time decision-making** while improving **medical understanding of key diagnostic features**.
