## Key Findings and Results
**1. Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Class Imbalance Analysis:** To ensure that machine learning models do not favor the majority class which may be leading to biased predictions and poor generalization, we show the individual class distributions in our dataset in the the following plot:
  ![plot](Image/class_dist.png)
  
The figure reveals a significant class imbalance, with the first class (shown in red) comprising 30.6% of the total distribution and having approximately at least twice the frequency of any other class. Class 6 (in yellow) represents the smallest segment at only 5.46% of the total, illustrating a highly skewed distribution. However, for the dermatology domain specifically, these imbalances likely reflect the natural rarity of certain skin conditions or clinical signs, making it particularly important to employ techniques that maintain the representation of these minority classes.
- **Feature Distribution Analysis:** The following figure presents the distribution of 34 numerical features, providing visualization of how each clinical sign or symptom is distributed across samples:
  
   ![plot](Image/feature_dist.png)

Most features are discrete, with values like 0, 1, 2, or 3, representing the severity or presence of specific dermatological attributes. The visualizations clearly indicate that some features exhibit high skewed distributions rather than normal (Gaussian) distributions. Features like "erythema" (Î¼: 2.07), "scaling" (Î¼: 1.80) show strong positive skewness, while many others like "follicular papules" (Î¼: 0.17) and "family history" (Î¼: 0.13) appear almost binary in nature. This skewness is crucial to recognize in selecting the proper machine learning algorithms because most parametric machine learning models inherently assume *normally distributed* data. 

-**Feature Correlation Heatmap:** The following figure reveals Spearman correlation heatmap. 
![plot](Image/feature_correlation.png)
This shows meaningful patterns of association that reflect underlying pathophysiological processes in skin diseases. Such natural groupings of features that can happen together provide valuable insights for disease classification by highlighting characteristic of specifi conditions, while also identifying features that tend to present independently of others. Additionally, the relatively weak associations between patient age and most clinical features suggest that dermatological conditions in this dataset occurs independently of age, indicating that algorithms may not require age-related adjustments. 
- **Outlier Detection:** Outlier analysis is important as it can indicate dat entery errors, measurement errors, and rare conditions. To ensure data quality and address potential outliers, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using multiple methods. First, we applied univariate techniques, including the **Z-score test** and the **IQR test**, to detect outliers in individual features. Since the Z-score and IQR methods sometimes produced different results (as detailed in the table provided in EDA.ipynb notebook), we used box plots to visually compare and justify these differences.
![plot](Image/feature_boxplot.png)
Next, we employed the **Isolation Forest** algorithm to perform *multivariate* outlier detection, identifying nine potential outliers. To further investigate, we conducted PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to visualize the data distribution and assess whether these points formed isolated clusters. As shown in the PCA plot, the data points formed well-defined clusters corresponding to different classes. Based on these findings, we concluded that the identified "outliers" were meaningful variations rather than errors or noise, and we retained all data points for further analysis.
![plot](Image/outlier_pca.png)
- **Understanding of Data using t-SNE:** We used t-SNE to visualize how the data naturally forms clusters. The results showed that some classes, like 1, 3, and 6, are clearly separated into distinct groups, making them easier to classify. However, other classes, such as 2, 4, and 5, overlap significantly, which makes it harder to distinguish them visually or through classification models. 
![plot](Image/tsne.png)

**2. Data Preprocessing:**
  - **Train-test Split:** We did perform a train-test split before data preprocessing to avoid **data leakage** for standardization, imputation and so forth.
  - **Handling Missing Values:** Our statistical analysis revealed that the age attribute has missing values. In this part we handle the missing values by comparing different imputation methods: median, mean and KNN imputations.
![plot](Image/imputed_ages.png)
As can be seen, the probability density distribution of the *'age'* variable shows significant overlap between values. To preserve the original age distribution, we chose the simplest imputation method: using the median. This approach ensures that the age variable remains consistent with the dataset's overall structure and avoids introducing bias.
 
**3. ML model Training:** 


  We selected different classifiers with unique strengths that make it suitable for handling our dataset, which includes imbalanced classes and skewed features. **SVM** is robust for moderately   imbalanced data because it focuses on support vectors near decision boundaries, making it less influenced by outliers or majority-class dominance. **Random Forest** and **Extra Trees** are ensemble methods that handle imbalanced data effectively by combining multiple decision trees. **Naive Bayes**, though simple, works well with skewed data due to its probabilistic approach, which assumes feature independence but can still provide quick and interpretable results. Lastly, **KNN** is sensitive to class imbalance but can be tuned with weighted voting to improve performance in overlapping or minority-class regions.
  -**Pipelines:** We created different preprocessing steps for our models. For SVM, KNN, and Naive Bayes, we standardized the data to make sure all features are on the same scale, which helps these models work better. For XG Boost, Random Forest and Extra Trees, we didn't standardize because these models can handle features of different scales naturally.

 - **Class Weightingh** We assigned higher weights to the minority class, forcing the model to pay more attention to its patterns and reducing bias toward the majority class.
 - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: We decided to choose *Baysin Hyperparameter Optimization (Optuna)* rather than *grid search* because it efficiently navigates the hyperparameter space by building a probabilistic model, leading to better performance with fewer evaluations. The following parameters is chosen for each classifier:
   - **SVM**:
       -  **C:** regularization parameter that managing the model's complexity.
       - **Gamma:** determines how far the influence of a single training example reaches, with low values meaning 'far' and high values meaning 'close'. 
       - **Kernel function:** transforms the input data into a higher-dimensional space, enabling the SVM to handle non-linear classification problems by finding an optimal hyperplane.
   - **XG Boost/Random Forest/ Extra Tree**
       - **learning_rate:** controls the contribution of each new tree to the overall model.
       -  **max_depth:** sets the maximum depth of each decision tree.
       -   **subsample:** denotes the fraction of the training data to be randomly sampled for each boosting round.
       -   **colsample_bytree:** represents the fraction of features to be randomly sampled for each tree.
       -   **min_samples_split:** the minimum number of samples required at an internal node to consider splitting it into further sub-nodes.
    - **KNN**
      - **Distance Metric:** Euclidean, Manhattan.
      - **Number of Neighbors:** Number of nearest neighbor to consider.
      - **Distance Weights:** Neighbors closer to the query point have a greater influence on the prediction than those farther away.
- **Perfromance Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1
  
**4. Best Model Selection**


  As can be seen in the following figure, the **Extra Trees Classifier** performed the best, achieving an **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 0.986486**. This suggests that it consistently makes correct predictions across all classes. Looking at class 6 (the rare class), Extra Trees successfully identified **4 instances correctly** with no misclassifications, demonstrating its strength in handling imbalanced data. This suggests that the model benefits from its **ensemble nature and ability to reduce overfitting**, making it the most reliable choice for this dataset.

**5. Feature Importance Analysis**


  The following figure illustrates feature importance rankings derived from different classifiers. Across the models, certain features consistently appear as highly important, such as "fibrosis of the papillary dermis," "vacuolisation and damage of the basal layer," and "clubbing of the rete ridges." This consistency suggests these features are critical for distinguishing dermatological conditions regardless of the classifier used. Additionally, permutation-based methods (SVM, Naive Bayes, KNN) focus on different features compared to built-in importance measures (XGBoost, Random Forest). This highlights the need for careful selection of feature importance techniques depending on the model.

**6. SHAP Analysis of Feature Importance**


The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) figure provides a detailed breakdown of feature importance across six dermatological conditions. For instance, the SHAP analysis for **psoriasis** identifies **"Clubbing of the rete ridges"** as the most influential feature, with a high positive SHAP value indicating its strong contribution to psoriasis classification. "Thinning of the suprapapillary epidermis" and "spongiosis" also emerge as significant contributors, reflecting important histopathological characteristics of psoriasis. Other features like "elongation of the rete ridges" and "fibrosis of the papillary dermis" play a secondary role but still provide meaningful contributions. The prominence of these features aligns with clinical findings, where epidermal changes and dermal inflammation are central to psoriasis pathology. In addition, the SHAP visualizations reveal several cross-condition patterns in feature importance. For example, while **"fibrosis of the papillary dermis"** is critical for **chronic dermatitis** classification, it plays a less significant role in other conditions like **psoriasis**. Similarly, features like "clubbing of the rete ridges" show variable importance across conditionsâ€”being highly influential for psoriasis but less so for **pityriasis rubra pilaris**.

# Dataset Information

This database contains 34 attributes, 33 of which are linear valued and one of them is nominal. 

The differential diagnosis of erythemato-squamous diseases is a real problem in dermatology. They all share the clinical features of erythema and scaling, with very little differences. The diseases in this group are psoriasis, seboreic dermatitis, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, cronic dermatitis, and pityriasis rubra pilaris. Usually a biopsy is necessary for the diagnosis but unfortunately these diseases share many histopathological features as well. Another difficulty for the differential diagnosis is that a disease may show the features of another disease at the beginning stage and may have the characteristic features at the following stages. Patients were first evaluated clinically with 12 features. Afterwards, skin samples were taken for the evaluation of 22 histopathological features. The values of the histopathological features are determined by an analysis of the samples under a microscope. 

In the dataset constructed for this domain, the family history feature has the value 1 if any of these diseases has been observed in the family, and 0 otherwise. The age feature simply represents the age of the patient. Every other feature (clinical and histopathological) was given a degree in the range of 0 to 3. Here, 0 indicates that the feature was not present, 3 indicates the largest amount possible, and 1, 2 indicate the relative intermediate values.

The names and id numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database.
